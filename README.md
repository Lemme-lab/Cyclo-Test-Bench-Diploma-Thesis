# Cyclo Test-Bench Diploma Thesis

Welcome to the repository for my part of the diploma thesis on the Cyclo Test-Bench (CTB) project.

## Overview

The Cyclo Test-Bench CTB project involves the realization of a new type of drone propulsion system based on the Voith-Schneider principle. This thesis focuses on controlling a test bench designed for measuring critical aviation data, such as thrust measurement.

## Achievements

- Winner of the 'INNOVATION@SCHOOL' competition.
  - Developed by Lucas Lenarcic, Matteo MÃ¼ller, and Tim Sperle.
  - Secured 1st place out of 71 submissions.
  - Partnered with Infineon Technologies.

- Top 5 finalist in the 'Mobility' category at the Bosch Innovationspreis 2024.

The thesis explores a novel drone propulsion system based on the Voith-Schneider propeller, with applications in aviation, vehicle, and marine propulsion. It aims to assess its performance against traditional drone propulsion systems through a test bench measuring parameters like rotational speed, blade angle, direction, and thrust force. The project integrates Infineon Technologies' Hall-effect sensors for precise data collection.

## Technical Details

The project involves:
- Building a server for hosting services and managing data efficiently.
- Configuring a specialized database solution.
- Selecting and setting up a web hosting service.
- Developing a frontend interface for data visualization.

The backend structure is designed to handle specific project requirements and future expansions. The interface connects the frontend, database, and measurement station using a REST API implemented with Node.js and Express.js. It includes endpoints for data read/write operations and test bench control.
